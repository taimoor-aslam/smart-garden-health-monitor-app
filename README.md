A new Flutter application. This Smart Garden Monitor Health App is a cross platfrom application for the users to manage their gardens remotely. 
The purpose of this application is to create a convenient and easy-to-use mobile application which will help in growing their plants 
in a better way like it’ll notify user if the water level in garden is dangerously low, temperature isn’t moderate for plants, moisture in the 
soul isn’t well enough to grow and to use dehumidifiers in case of excessive humidity. For this purpose, application will be connected to Arduino
board via WIFI/Bluetooth. The Arduino board will be further having sensors for temperature, humidity, soil moisture and light sensors to get 
readings for these factors in the garden. These readings are used to suggest an action to the user of this application.
